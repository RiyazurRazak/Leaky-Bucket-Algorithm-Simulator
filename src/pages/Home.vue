       <p class="desc">Leaky Bucket Algorithm mainly controls the total amount and the rate of the traffic sent to the network.</p>
       <ul>
        <li>
          Let us imagine a bucket with a small hole at the bottom where the rate at which water is poured into the bucket is not constant and can vary but it leaks from the bucket at a constant rate.
        </li>
        <li>
          So (up to water is present in the bucket), the rate at which the water leaks does not depend on the rate at which the water is input to the bucket.
        </li>
        <li>
           If the bucket is full, additional water that enters into the bucket that spills over the sides and is lost.
        </li>
        <li>
           Thus the same concept applied to packets in the network. Consider that data is coming from the source at variable speeds. Suppose that a source sends data at 10 Mbps for 4 seconds. Then there is no data for 3 seconds. The source again transmits data at a rate of 8 Mbps for 2 seconds. Thus, in a time span of 8 seconds, 68 Mb data has been transmitted.
        </li>
       </ul>
      <p>Thatâ€™s why if a leaky bucket algorithm is used, the data flow would be 8 Mbps for 9 seconds. Thus, the constant flow is maintained.</p>
